# Description of the project

The Airbnb Clone project aims to replicate the core features of the Airbnb platform,
providing users with a platform to list their properties for short-term rentals
and enabling other users to discover and book accommodations for their travel needs.

# Description of the command interpreter
The Airbnb Command Interpreter is a text-based interface designed to interact
with the Airbnb Clone project. Users can perform various actions,
such as searching for accommodations, making bookings, managing listings, and more,
all through a series of command-line inputs.
